The following corrected CSS code addresses the overflow issue:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: auto; /* Added width: auto */
  min-width: 100px; /* Ensure minimum width */
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

By using `width: auto;`, the flex items will now automatically adjust their width to fit within the container, preventing overflow and maintaining the intended even spacing between them.  `min-width: 100px;` is added to prevent the items from shrinking smaller than intended.
